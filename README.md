# distantNodes
A C++ nodal programation implementation that you control with a web interface based on NoFlo.js

----

## cppNodesAPI
The C++ files in `cppNodesAPI` are to be used on the host application (written in C++).
It's important that this API doesn't depend on too much dependencies to maximise compatibility.

## jsControlUI
This is the web-based interface that lets you manipulate what's happening on the host.
It provides a visual programation UI based on [TheGraph](http://github.com/the-grid/the-graph) and [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

To Install:
 - Install npm, bower (_and maybe other tools?_)
 - `cd /path/to/jsControlUI`
 - `bower install`
 - `npm install`

Start the app:
 - `npm start`

Under construction - more info soon!
